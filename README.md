Did the internet connection ever go out on your chrome browser and you were stuck without WI-FI playing the dinosaur game as you jump over cacti and under pterodactyls? I know I have and I know many of us have played the game. Well let me tell you I have made a new game that reimagines the same feeling of playing the dinosaur game with color in a vibrant background where you can race against everyone else around the world and have rivals in the game that you try to beat. Why not try it out?
